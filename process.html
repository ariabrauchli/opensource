                        <p>Throughout this capstone project, I took lead responsibility for the entire physical design and fabrication process of our custom bed system, from early CAD work to the final milled prototype. My work spanned parametric modeling, CNC machining, prototyping, testing, and final media production — forming the backbone of the project's technical development.</p>

                        <h3>CAD & Parametric Design</h3>
                        <p>I created the full 3D model of our transforming van bed system using Onshape, taking advantage of its collaborative tools and parametric design capabilities. Parametric modeling involves using variables to control features like bed dimensions and part thickness, so the model updates responsively when values change. This makes it highly adaptable across different vehicle platforms and user preferences.</p>

                        <h3>CNC Machining & Fabrication</h3>
                        <p>While modeling was done in Onshape, I transitioned to Fusion 360 to handle CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) and toolpathing for CNC milling. I learned the entire CAM workflow, including machine-specific constraints like tool size and material allowances, and milled the physical prototype from Baltic birch plywood. I also performed all physical prototyping, from laser-cut models to full-scale CNC milled assemblies.</p>

                        <h3>Iteration, Testing & Ergonomics</h3>
                        <p>The project included continuous iterations based on hands-on testing and expert feedback. I assembled multiple prototypes, refining tolerances and joint designs, and researched ergonomics to improve user comfort and functionality. I also conducted expert interviews with van conversion industry professionals, which guided improvements in design for manufacturability and ease of use.</p>

                        <h3>Team Support & Coordination</h3>
                        <p>In addition to my own work, I coordinated with teammates in later phases to support their roles — including cushion production (Sammy) and web development (Aria). I shared technical guidance and helped ensure our contributions aligned for final integration.</p>

                        <h3>Media & Final Presentation</h3>
                        <p>I planned and filmed drone footage of the final product and led the editing of the final video, showcasing both the functionality of the bed system and the process behind its development.</p>

                        <h3>Week 2</h3>
                        <p>I focused on getting fully up to speed with Fusion 360 by completing a Skillshare tutorial. While I had previous experience with Onshape and SolidWorks, Fusion offered a new workflow for CAM and CNC-specific design. I found the interface intuitive and felt confident in my ability to use it for upcoming fabrication tasks. However, I didn't complete our reach goal of recreating the bed in Fusion, due to time constraints. Still, I gained the necessary foundation to move quickly in the following weeks.</p>

                        <h3>Week 3</h3>
                        <p>I completed the first parametric version of the bed model in Onshape, using global variables to define key dimensions such as bed length, thickness, and slat spacing. This made the design responsive and easily adaptable to different van configurations. I also conducted a one-on-one interview with our mentor to validate the parametric flexibility and discuss structural and ergonomic considerations. We identified issues that could arise during CNC translation and real-world use, such as instability at larger sizes and the importance of smooth sliding and folding mechanisms. These insights highlighted the need for physical prototyping and usability testing moving forward.</p>

                        <h3>Week 4</h3>
                        <p>This week was a huge leap forward in fabrication. I learned how to create toolpaths in Fusion 360's CAM environment, designed specifically for CNC milling. With support from our mentor Jeff, I completed the full workflow for using the CNC machine. We cut and assembled the first full-scale prototype, which revealed key challenges around tolerances and alignment. Understanding the physical constraints of our CNC machine and the specific bits it uses helped me refine the digital model for better compatibility with real-world fabrication.</p>

                        <h3>Week 5</h3>
                        <p>Building on feedback from our initial prototype, I iterated on the CAD design to improve glue joint alignment, address tolerance issues, and add features like adjustable backrest props. I spent a significant amount of time refining part geometry and ensuring the parametric structure remained stable. I also laser cut a scaled version of the updated model to verify improvements before milling again. In parallel, I participated in business plan development and worked with Sammy on our PSO statement, helping shape our approach for potential commercialization.</p>

                        <h3>Week 6</h3>
                        <p>I conducted our first expert interview with <strong>Cam Mahoney</strong>, a veteran van builder, and received actionable feedback on our design's marketability, safety, and usability. Cam emphasized the need for the bed system to be at least 90–100% complete before testing user assembly, suggesting that our next phase involve someone attempting to follow instructions to build it themselves. He also recommended modular mounting options like T-tracks and explained how commercial builds often face DOT compliance issues. Though I was distracted by flying to Minnesota to pick up my own van (a personal milestone!), I still made strong progress and gathered valuable insight.</p>

                        <h3>Week 7</h3>
                        <p>I met with our second expert, <strong>Mark Woodard</strong>, at Geotrek's warehouse and demoed our Onshape model. He gave helpful feedback on usability, including the idea of offering simplified presets (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) to reduce user overwhelm during customization. We also explored material options and mounting strategies. I finalized decisions around wood type and thickness, and scheduled our next milling session. Although I was excited by progress, I also began to feel the strain of being the primary technical lead, especially as team motivation seemed to dip.</p>

                        <h3>Week 8</h3>
                        <p>Although we had to postpone milling our second prototype due to a late-discovered design issue, I made significant progress finalizing the parametric model and generating all toolpaths. I purchased Baltic birch for the next version and prepared for cutting. I also launched a post on Facebook Marketplace offering "Custom CNC beds cut to order," which led to some initial interest — possibly our first customer. Additionally, I got external validation through forum discussions and even a job offer to design van furniture. These moments boosted my confidence and affirmed the project's real-world potential. Team communication improved this week too.</p>

                        <h3>Week 9</h3>
                        <p>This week marked the final push toward project completion. I successfully milled the final version of the bed on the CNC machine using our refined Fusion toolpaths and high-quality Baltic birch. Assembly went smoothly thanks to earlier adjustments in the parametric model, which minimized alignment and tolerance issues. The final build showcased the culmination of all prior design iterations and prototyping work. Additionally, I updated our Facebook Marketplace listing to feature photos and video of the finished product, which significantly improved its presentation and potential appeal to real-world customers, and I received a ton of interest from customers.</p>

                        <h3>Weeks 10 & 11</h3>
                        <p>Though I didn't formally log these weeks, my efforts focused on coordination, support, and final media production. I guided Sammy through finalizing the cushions to fit our milled design and helped Aria with content integration for the website. I wrapped up video editing, making sure our final deliverables clearly communicated the functionality and flexibility of the system. These weeks were less about new technical challenges and more about ensuring our presentation matched the quality of our build.</p>

                    <p>The documentation process is underway, but as it is the first week and we do not have a van, there is not much to document. Due to travel and doctor appointments, I have not had time to get into a workflow this week, which is when I work best. I have been able to manage quick bursts of work and will be able to focus more starting tomorrow. I have, however, found multiple other van instructables online, such as websites and (sorry Annie) Tik Tok. (It's good for something at least!)</p>
                    <p>There have been no files to save yet. This will be a weekly goal.</p>
                    <p>I have successfully organized the Google Drive. Everything is organized into folders. This successfully declutters everything and makes navigation easier.</p>

                    <p>I write all feedback down where it is most convenient at the time, which has been the notes app on my phone. Later, I review the feedback to prioritize suggestions that align with my project's goals, focusing on areas that will have the greatest impact. I also share feedback with my team to brainstorm effective solutions.</p>
                    <p>I learned that when I have inconsistencies in my schedule, such as a time zone change, it becomes a lot more difficult for me to keep track of my normal schedule and I end up getting off track and missing things. I am on a slight delay, but only by an hour or two. My mind wants to be on vacation mode as it usually is when I travel, but this is not a vacation. I have learned to set time aside each day to work on my assignments and make progress. My house in DC has a really nice fireplace that makes it easier to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Week 3</h3>
                    <p>I had a hectic week traveling for medical reasons, so I had to miss class. Over the weekend, Charlie and Sammy filled me in, and I tackled the work in a sprint rather than a marathon, which usually suits me well. I think I made a decent amount of progress. I also got stuck on an error that broke the whole website and ended up spending many hours on that. As of now, I have a very basic website design, but at least it looks better than it did without css. I have also added the links for the navigation bar, although there isn't much to add yet. I will be continuing to add substance to these pages weekly.</p>
                    <p>Before starting on my next goals, I have discussions with my group about what we did and what we need to work on. After missing class, Charlie filled me in and gave me feedback on what I've done and instructed me on what to work on next. This helped me understand what needed improvement and what to focus on next. This helps me prioritize my work.</p>
                    <p>I had a major setback this week. My whole website became inaccessible! After every change I made and pushed into the repository, I would refresh the website so I could see what it looked like. It often ended up being quite slow to see the results. It's taken up to 40 minutes of refreshing before I see any changes. I added CSS styling, and when it finally updated, I couldn't access the page. I had no idea what I had done wrong because I've added similar CSS styling many times before without this happening. I immediately deleted the CSS file, but 40 minutes later, it was still the same. I spent hours on google (some of my search history is below) trying to find a solution. I ended up trying three different things. I'd wait twenty minutes in between each solution, but it wasn't clear which trick finally did it. It was really unexpected for me because everything was going so smoothly beforehand. I ended up working on this for hours. I learned that debugging web issues, especially deployment-related ones, requires a lot of patience and troubleshooting across multiple areas. I hadn't anticipated how long it would take for my changes to reflect, and it was frustrating not knowing if my fixes were working.</p>

                    <h3>Week 4</h3>
                    <p>One thing I'm learning is that things don't always go as planned. Sometimes it can be good and sometimes it can be bad. A goal this week was to populate all pages of the website, but I quickly realized that I don't have any content for a majority of the pages. My plan for next week is to sit down and completely revamp the website. I really want to get better at HTML and CSS, but they weren't offering any classes that fit my schedule this semester. I did populate some pages, however. That took a couple hours.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/DUlPHkL.png" alt="Website CSS and styling progress screenshot">
                    </div>
                    <p>My second goal was to start building the Instagram page. I have since posted a photo and a video. I have been maintaining it every couple of hours or so by following and engaging with new accounts. I think I may need to slow my roll here because we don't have any actual postable original content yet, but I am going to try to make a progress reel soon.</p>
                    <p>I also reached my goal of getting 25 followers. As of now, I have 62 followers. That's about half the followers I have for my photography Instagram, and I've had that for years. I have been putting a lot of effort into doing this, which feels weird because I rarely post on Instagram. I have been managing my time quite well. I try to go on the account every time I open Instagram.</p>
                    <p>I have not yet fixed the incognito issue, but that should hopefully be solved by next week.</p>
                    <p>I also spent the afternoon at the Dawson school with Charlie. I recorded footage and learned about the machines, which I found pretty cool. I hope to do more of this.</p>
                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rbE2b3a.png" alt="Dawson School machines and learning experience">
                    </div>
                    <p>I am adjusting the content I put on Instagram, because I want followers to think I'm authentic, and not a bot. I have realized that the website cannot be thoroughly populated yet, so I am going to adjust and focus on the styling for now. I will make more reels as short form videos hook users.</p>
                    <p>One big takeaway this week is that having a plan is great, but being flexible is just as important. I set out to populate all the website pages, but after realizing I didn't have enough content, I had to rethink my approach. Instead of rushing to fill empty pages, I decided to take a step back and focus on creating quality content first. Spending time at Dawson School also gave me a new perspective. I really enjoyed recording and learning about the machines, which wasn't originally part of my plan. It made me realize that I want to do more hands-on content creation or at least witness it.</p>

                    <h3>Week 5</h3>
                    <p>I managed to overwork myself with the amount of goals I had this week, and unfortunately, I did not get a lot done. I ended up catching the flu and have been stuck with a 102 degree fever for the past five days, with no signs of improvement. My plan was to meet with Sena in class and she would walk me through the security issues, but I was unable to get that done. I woke up at 4 PM today despite setting multiple alarms, so I missed the zoom session as well. I have been posting at least one video a day and we have made it to 81 followers! I haven't revamped the website yet because I am living in a foggy haze and cannot think for the life of me. I feel really bad for putting myself and possibly my group behind.</p>
                    <p>Sammy showed me this really cool platform accessible through ChatGPT to help me create reels. After playing around with it, I realized that it wasn't as seamless as it seemed and that it would cost a lot of money to get it to do what I wanted it to do. I told this to Charlie and Sammy, and Charlie suggested I start taking other creator's content, so I've drafted a couple messages and will hopefully have some "original" content (not AI but not my own) by the end of this week. I will of course be crediting their work to avoid lawsuits.</p>
                    <p>Getting the flu was pretty unexpected. I didn't even know I had been exposed because I have been spending all my time at home because it's cold. I learned that getting sick like this could really put me behind so I need to start planning ahead more for unforeseen circumstances. I also thought that the ChatGPT video creation would be a seamless solution, but that was not the case either.</p>

                    <h3>Week 6</h3>
                    <p>My original goal was to work on the website. I kept that vague on purpose because I honestly wasn't sure how much I'd be able to accomplish each week. I always try to do as much as I can, but sometimes I end up doing more than I planned, or I shift focus to something that feels more important in the moment. What I'm really aiming for is a final website that looks professional and thoughtfully designed, not something that feels like it was thrown together after one basic HTML class. To help make that happen, I enrolled in an online course to sharpen my skills and improve the overall design. I've also been working on optimizing the site for mobile, although that has been a slower process. Alongside that, I've been sketching out ideas for how I want the finished version to look.</p>
                    <p>As for how I've been responding to feedback, I had a good conversation with Charlie about some parts of the original site that we hadn't addressed yet. I mentioned a few tabs that still didn't have clear direction. We decided together that I should move toward a layout that keeps most of the content on a single page, with skip navigation to make things easier to access. He also pointed out that I should focus more on mobile usability, which I hadn't really considered until he brought it up. That feedback helped shift the way I think about the project, and I've made it a priority since then.</p>
                    <p>One of the most unexpected challenges recently has been getting sick. I thought I had the flu, but I tested negative for everything, including COVID. It feels like the bronchitis I had over winter break came back, and it's been really hard to keep my energy up. On top of that, a close friend was diagnosed with cancer, and I lost another friend entirely. It's been an overwhelming and emotional week. It feels like every semester comes with something major like this, but I'm learning how to stay grounded when things fall apart. In the past, I might have shut down completely and failed, but now I'm at least still here, still trying. I might turn things in late sometimes, but I'm learning how to push through instead of giving up. I've also realized that people have expectations, and if you don't meet them, it can lead to disappointment or low grades. That's a hard lesson to keep learning. It's difficult to communicate when I'm barely functioning and all I want to do is shut down, but I'm doing my best. Charlie suggested I go for a walk, and I did. It didn't fix everything, but it helped a little, and that was enough for that day.</p>
                    <h3>Week 7</h3>
                    <p>This week, I was able to optimize the website for mobile, which felt like a big win. But through that process, I also realized that my web design skills aren't where I want them to be. I've been doing my best to stay on track, but some things have taken more time than I expected. What worked well was setting flexible goals and just making steady progress. What didn't work was trying to figure things out on the fly when I didn't have the skills yet. That's why I decided to enroll in an online course. I'm hoping it will help me build the kind of website I actually want to create.</p>
                    <p>I've also had to make some big changes based on feedback. Since we only have one product, the layout of the website has to change a lot. I need to rethink how to organize everything. I fixed the mobile layout, but Charlie pointed out that the navigation bar was missing on some pages, so I'll need to fix that. We also talked about getting rid of the navigation bar completely and just putting everything on one page. Right now, I'm thinking about having two pages instead, one for the background and one for the actual product. I'm still figuring it out, but I feel like I have a better plan now.</p>
                    <h3>Week 8</h3>
                    <p>This week, my main goal was to make serious progress on the website, and I've been working really hard to get there. I signed up for an online HTML course to improve my skills. While the course wasn't exactly what I needed, I still learned a lot from it. I've been putting in long hours, staying up late, and even pulling a few all-nighters to keep building and refining the site. After several versions and a lot of experimenting, I'm finally starting to create something I actually feel proud of.</p>
                    <p>I made the decision early on to code the site manually instead of using a website builder like Wix. I want it to look polished and unique, not like a drag-and-drop template. That's made the process more challenging, but also more rewarding. The layout is coming together, the structure makes sense, and I've already optimized it for mobile. I've also started gathering everything I need to finish the site, including headshots, clean renders of the product, high-quality photos of the final build, and a link to a view-only Onshape file where users can purchase the cut file.</p>
                    <p>Feedback has played a big part in helping me shape the site. I asked several people about the layout and how many pages would make sense. Based on their input, I decided to keep it as a multi-page site. One page will focus on the product, while another will give background information about our project and process. That approach feels more balanced and user-friendly.</p>
                    <p>On a more personal note, this week has been emotionally intense. Mei Mei stopped eating again, and it felt like another death scare. It shook me up more than I expected, and balancing that emotional weight with all the work has been tough. Still, I've kept showing up and doing what I can. I'm learning how to keep moving forward when things feel uncertain and how to keep building even when it hurts.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I'm proud of the progress I've made. It hasn't been easy, but I've stayed committed and kept pushing through. The site is finally starting to reflect the vision I had when I started, and I'm excited to keep going and bring it fully to life.</p>
                    <h3>Week 9</h3>
                    <p>My goal for this week was to completely finish the website. I'm proud to say that I did it. All the content is in place, it's styled with CSS, and honestly, I think it looks pretty good. There's still room for polishing, but it's functional, presentable, and complete. To get it done, I pulled three all-nighters. I work best in long, intense sprints, and once I get into the zone, it's hard to stop. Each sprint lasted over 12 hours. I canceled all my plans, barely left my room, and just kept pushing through until it was done.</p>
                    <p>Time management was intense, but it worked for me. I wasn't able to spread the work out like I'd originally planned, but the all-or-nothing approach helped me lock in and make it happen. It wasn't sustainable long-term, but for this final push, it got the job done.</p>
                    <p>I also had to respond to some unexpected challenges. Charlie got COVID this week, which meant I had to learn his part of the presentation in one day while also finishing the website. We went through the slides together multiple times, and I took detailed notes on everything he said I missed. When it came time to present, I was able to include about 95 percent of what we had planned. That felt like a win.</p>
                    <p>This week taught me a lot about my own expectations. I went into this thinking building a website would be easy and fun, but I didn't realize how much I still didn't know. There are so many tools and frameworks, like Bootstrap and more advanced JavaScript, that I haven't fully learned yet. I do know a bit of JavaScript, but not enough to build exactly what I wanted. At times I felt pretty discouraged for overestimating my skills. It's frustrating to be a senior and still feel like there's so much left to learn.</p>

                    <h3>Week 10</h3>
                    <p>This week, my goals were to make the website secure and do some basic editing, like fixing typos and alignment issues. I'm happy to say I met both of those goals. I finally figured out how to secure the website, thanks to a lot of trial and error and help from online resources. It took hours, but nothing too extreme. I also went through and cleaned up text errors and spacing issues. The only thing I couldn't quite figure out was adjusting the margins of the contact box, which was more complicated than I expected.</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>Time management went fairly well. I paced things out over the week and didn't have to rely on a last-minute sprint. That felt like a step forward. Still, there's always more to learn and do. Even after completing what I set out to do, I realized how much room for improvement there still is.</p>
                    <p>After I met my goals, I met with Charlie, who shared that we need to shift the direction of the website to better match a slightly new vision for the project. That means I'll need to do a full revamp soon. It was a little overwhelming to hear that after I had just finished everything for the week, but I'm going to start working on those changes. We also received feedback that the product shouldn't be offered for free anymore. So now, instead of giving users direct access to an adaptable CAD file, we'll be requiring a contact form submission for purchase.</p>
                    <p>This week was a reminder that a project is never really done. Even when something feels finished, there's usually more to improve. I've been working hard to feel like I'm doing enough, and the idea of redoing the site right before my birthday is stressful. My best friend, who I haven't seen in years, is flying out this weekend, and I don't know if I'll have time to actually enjoy it. Weekends are usually the only time I have to really get things done, so I'm feeling the pressure. Still, I'm proud that I learned how to secure a site and that I've been sticking with this, even when it's hard. I'm doing my best to keep moving forward.</p>
                    <h3>Week 11</h3>
                    <p>With the help of Sammy, the website has now been completely redesigned to reflect a more intentional and professional structure. We've moved from a multi-tab layout to a consolidated, streamlined experience that is easier for users to navigate. Instead of offering free downloadable files, we now require visitors to fill out a contact form to request a purchase. This change helps us protect our intellectual property and aligns better with our long-term business model. I spent the week implementing this new layout, troubleshooting navigation inconsistencies, and testing the mobile view on various devices. I also began drafting updated website copy with a more cohesive tone. It's starting to feel like a real business now, not just a class project. I'm finally finding some satisfaction in how everything is coming together, even though it's been a long road.</p>

                    <h3>Week 12</h3>
                    <p>This week was about polishing and preparing. I fine-tuned the margins and spacing across the site and made sure all links are functional and redirect correctly. I coordinated with Charlie and Sammy to gather the latest renders and updated product images for the site. We also added a testimonial section and began preparing the site for public launch. It's surreal to see how far we've come. What started as a rough HTML skeleton is now a fully functioning, mobile-optimized, visually cohesive site that represents our capstone project. I've grown a lot, not just technically, but also in how I handle unexpected setbacks and feedback. There's still more to do, but the foundation is finally solid. I feel proud of what I've built.</p>
