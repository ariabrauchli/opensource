                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <h4>Sammy:</h4>
                <p>This week, my main objectives were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conduct technical testing with Lexus.</li>
                    <li>Familiarize myself with G-code and CNC machining.</li>
                    <li>Create a basic proof of concept for our van conversion without spending money.</li>
                    <li>Learn and experiment with the CAM function in Fusion 360 to prepare for CNC machining next week.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Progress Made</h5>
                <p>I successfully built a basic proof of concept that fit in my car using only materials I had on hand. This took approximately nine hours over the course of two days, and I completed most of the work manually due to limited access to power tools. I also familiarized myself with Fusion 360's CAM function, which will help our group prepare for next week when we begin using the CNC machine.</p>
                
                <h5>Challenges Faced</h5>
                <p>Throughout the process, I encountered several obstacles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited resources and space made it difficult to work efficiently. I had to rely on friends for access to power tools, but much of the work—including extensive sawing—was done by hand.</li>
                    <li>Time constraints were an issue, as I worked past sunset, making it necessary to resume the following day.</li>
                    <li>Material difficulties included screws breaking and dealing with rusty nails, which slowed down the building process.</li>
                    <li>Fusion 360 CAM simulation issues arose as I attempted to learn by experimenting rather than strictly following a tutorial. This led to confusion and required me to watch additional videos for clarification.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>How I Overcame These Challenges</h5>
                <p>Although I wasn't able to fully overcome every challenge, I managed by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Working incrementally—continuing the next day when it was too dark to proceed.</li>
                    <li>Utilizing available resources—borrowing power tools from friends while still relying heavily on manual labor.</li>
                    <li>Expanding my knowledge—watching more tutorials to better understand the CAM simulation in Fusion 360.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Next Steps</h5>
                <p>Next week, our focus will be on using the CNC machine to take our prototype to the next level. My personal goals include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Strengthening my understanding of G-code, as I haven't used it in a while.</li>
                    <li>Acquiring additional materials at the lowest possible cost to modify and improve the proof of concept.</li>
                    <li>Applying what I learned from Fusion 360 CAM to ensure a smooth CNC machining process.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Resources and Support</h5>
                <p>Fortunately, our team has all the necessary support for this phase of the project. We have access to:</p>

                </ul>
                
                <h5>Key Takeaways from This Week</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manufacturing and prototyping are incredibly exciting—I enjoy these hands-on stages of the project.</li>
                    <li>Working with limited resources forces creative problem-solving, making me more adaptable.</li>
                    <li>Fusion 360 CAM and CNC preparation take time to master, but I am making progress.</li>
                    <li>Building the proof of concept has helped refine my ideas for the final product, and I look forward to improving it further.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Final Reflection</h5>
                <p>I love the manufacturing and prototyping process, which makes these steps of the project particularly exciting. Next week's CNC machining will be a major milestone, and I'm eager to see how the prototype evolves. I look forward to testing new design ideas, refining my work, and gaining more hands-on experience with advanced fabrication tools.</p>

                <h3>Week 9</h3>
                <h4>Sammy – Week 9 Progress Update</h4>
                <h5>Goals for This Week:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finalize and prepare the team presentation.</li>
                    <li>Apply for funding opportunities to support project development.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Accomplishments & Reflections:</h5>
                <p>This week, I focused on two key areas: preparing for our team presentation and submitting funding applications. I worked closely with my teammates to finalize our slides, practicing the delivery multiple times to ensure clarity, flow, and confidence. We paid close attention to integrating feedback from previous practice sessions and refining our narrative to better highlight the value and impact of our van conversion project.</p>
                <p>On the funding side, I researched and applied to several relevant opportunities, including startup-focused grants and university programs that align with our goals. This process helped clarify our financial needs and forced me to think critically about how to articulate our business case to potential funders.</p>
                
                <h5>Challenges & Lessons Learned:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Balancing Multiple Priorities: Juggling the presentation prep and funding applications simultaneously was a challenge, but breaking the work into smaller tasks and blocking out focused time helped.</li>
                    <li>Funding Applications Take Time: Completing the applications took longer than expected, especially when tailoring responses to different organizations.</li>
                    <li>Importance of a Strong Narrative: Working on the presentation reinforced how essential it is to have a cohesive, compelling story that ties together the technical, business, and user-focused aspects of our project.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Next Steps:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follow up on submitted funding applications and prepare additional materials if requested.</li>
                    <li>Incorporate feedback from the Week 9 presentation into our next iteration.</li>
                    <li>Support final prototyping and prepare materials for future marketing and user testing.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Week 10</h3>
                <h4>Week 10 – Final Progress Update</h4>
                <h4>Sammy</h4>
                
                <h5>Goals for This Week:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finalize the van bed model, complete with all cuts and final assembly.</li>
                    <li>Fit the completed model into my car, including floor fabrication.</li>
                    <li>Sew cushions for the bed to complete the prototype.</li>
                    <li>Support the website build-out with content and functionality feedback.</li>
                    <li>Assist in video production by capturing the final prototype in action.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h5>Accomplishments:</h5>
                <h6>Final Model Build:</h6>
                <p>I finished building the final version of the van bed, carefully finalizing all cuts and assembling the pieces. A big part of this was ensuring that everything fit together as planned, with proper tolerances and a smooth finish.</p>
                
                <h6>Vehicle Fitment:</h6>
                <p>After removing the seats from my car, I realized that the bed didn't sit flush. I had to fabricate a base floor for it to sit properly, which was unexpected but crucial for stability. This step added complexity, but the result was worth it—everything now fits securely.</p>
                
                <h6>Cushion Sewing:</h6>
                <p>I also sewed custom cushions for the bed. This took more time than anticipated due to some complications with the sewing pattern, particularly making sure the fit was tight but comfortable. Despite these challenges, the cushions turned out well and complete the overall look and functionality of the bed.</p>
                
                <h6>Video & Content Creation:</h6>
                <p>We drove into the mountains to get drone shots of the prototype in action. The video showcases the functionality and design of the bed in a real-world environment, adding great content for the website and our pitch materials. We also recorded the entire process of measuring the space in a vehicle, which will be part of the instructional content for future users.</p>
                
                <h6>Website Support:</h6>
                <p>I provided input and support for the final stages of building out the website. This included helping ensure that the user experience reflects our goals and that all visuals represent the product accurately.</p>
                
                <h5>Challenges & Lessons Learned:</h5>
                <h6>Base Floor Fabrication:</h6>
                <p>We didn't anticipate needing a base for the bed to sit properly in my car, which added unexpected work. Lesson: Every vehicle is different, and modularity needs to account for floor variation.</p>
                
                <h6>Sewing Challenges:</h6>
                <p>The sewing pattern for the cushions was more complicated than expected. Lesson: Prototyping with fabric demands patience, precision, and sometimes rework, but small tweaks make a big difference in comfort and aesthetics.</p>
                
                <h6>Time Management:</h6>
                <p>Balancing hands-on building, video production, and supporting the website was a lot, but focusing on one task at a time helped me stay on track.</p>
                
                <h5>Key Takeaways:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Seeing the bed fully assembled, fitted in the car, and with custom cushions was a huge milestone.</li>
                    <li>The drone footage and video content really brought the project to life and made all the hard work feel tangible and rewarding.</li>
                    <li>Supporting the website helped reinforce the importance of presenting our work professionally—good design is more than just the physical product, it's also about the user experience from the first interaction online.</li>
                </ul>
