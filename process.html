                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                    <p>The URL has been connected at https://opensourceopenroad.com/ :) Skeleton of the website is up. There is no CSS added to it. Documentation process is underway, but as it is the first week and we do not have a van, there is not much to document Due to travel and doctor appointments, I have not had time to get into a workflow this week, which is when I work best. I have been able to manage quick bursts of work and will be able to focus more starting tomorrow. I have, however, found multiple other van instructables online, such as websites and (sorry Annie) Tik Tok. (It's good for something at least!)</p>
                    <p>There have been no files to save yet. This will be a weekly goal.</p>
                    <p>I have successfully organized the Google Drive. Everything is organized into folders. This successfully declutters everything and makes navigation easier.</p>
                    <p>I write all feedback down where it is most convenient at the time, which has been the notes app on my phone. Later, I review the feedback to prioritize suggestions that align with my project's goals, focusing on areas that will have the greatest impact. I also share feedback with my team to brainstorm effective solutions.</p>
                    <p>I learned that when I have inconsistencies in my schedule, such as a time zone change, it becomes a lot more difficult for me to keep track of my normal schedule and I end up getting off track and missing things. I am on a slight delay, but only by an hour or two. My mind wants to be on vacation mode as it usually is when I travel, but this is not a vacation. I have learned to set time aside each day to work on my assignments and make progress. My house in DC has a really nice fireplace that makes it easier to do so.</p>

                    <h3>Week 3</h3>
                    <p>I had a hectic week traveling for medical reasons, so I had to miss class. Over the weekend, Charlie and Sammy filled me in, and I tackled the work in a sprint rather than a marathon, which usually suits me well. I think I made a decent amount of progress. I also got stuck on an error that broke the whole website and ended up spending many hours on that. As of now, I have a very basic website design, but at least it looks better than it did without css. I have also added the links for the navigation bar, although there isn't much to add yet. I will be continuing to add substance to these pages weekly.</p>
                    <p>Before starting on my next goals, I have discussions with my group about what we did and what we need to work on. After missing class, Charlie filled me in and gave me feedback on what I've done and instructed me on what to work on next. This helped me understand what needed improvement and what to focus on next. This helps me prioritize my work.</p>
                    <p>My whole website became inaccessible! After every change I made and pushed into the repository, I would refresh opensourceopenroad.com so I could see what it looked like. It often ended up being quite slow to see the results. It's taken up to 40 minutes of refreshing before I see any changes. I added css styling, and when it finally updated, I couldn't access the page. I had no idea what I had done wrong because I've added css many times before without this happening. I immediately deleted the CSS file, but 40 minutes later, it was still the same. I spent hours on google (some of my search history is below) trying to find a solution. I ended up trying three different things. I'd wait twenty minutes in between each solution, but it wasn't clear which trick finally did it. It was really unexpected for me because everything was going so smoothly beforehand. I ended up working on this for hours. I learned that debugging web issues, especially deployment-related ones, requires a lot of patience and troubleshooting across multiple areas. I hadn't anticipated how long it would take for my changes to reflect, and it was frustrating not knowing if my fixes were working.</p>

                    <h3>Week 4</h3>
                    <p>One thing I'm learning is that things don't always go as planned. Sometimes it can be good and sometimes it can be bad. A goal was to populate all pages of the website, but I quickly realized that I don't have any content for a majority of the pages. My plan for next week is to sit down and completely revamp the website. I really want to get better at HTML and CSS, but they weren't offering any classes that fit my schedule this semester. I did populate some pages, however. That took a couple hours.</p>
                    <p>My second goal was to start building the Instagram page. I have since posted a photo and a video. I have been maintaining it every couple of hours or so by following and engaging with new accounts. I think I may need to slow my roll here because we don't have any actual postable original content yet, but I am going to try to make a progress reel soon.</p>
                    <p>I also reached my goal of getting 25 followers. As of now, I have 62 followers. That's about half the followers I have for my photography instagram, and I've had that for years. I have been putting a lot of effort into doing this, which feels weird because I rarely post on Instagram. I have been managing my time quite well. I try to go on the account every time I open Instagram.</p>
                    <p>I have not yet fixed the incognito issue, but that should hopefully be solved by next week.</p>
                    <p>I also spent the afternoon at the Dawson school with Charlie. I recorded footage and learned about the machines, which I found pretty cool. I hope to do more of this.</p>
                    <p>I am adjusting the content I put on Instagram, because I want followers to think I'm authentic. I have realized that the website cannot be thoroughly populated yet, so I am going to adjust and focus on the styling for now. I will make more reels as short form videos hook users.</p>
                    <p>One big takeaway this week is that having a plan is great, but being flexible is just as important. I set out to populate all the website pages, but after realizing I didn't have enough content, I had to rethink my approach. Instead of rushing to fill empty pages, I decided to take a step back and focus on creating quality content first. Spending time at Dawson School also gave me a new perspective. I really enjoyed recording and learning about the machines, which wasn't originally part of my plan. It made me realize that I want to do more hands-on content creation or at least witness it.</p>

                    <h3>Week 5</h3>
                    <p>I managed to overwork myself with the amount of goals I had this week, and unfortunately, I did not get a lot done. I ended up catching the Flu and have been stuck with a 102 degree fever for the past five days, with no signs of improvement. My plan was to meet with Sena in class and she would walk me through the security issues, but I was unable to get that done. I woke up at 4 PM today despite setting multiple alarms, so I missed the zoom session as well. I have been posting at least one video a day, but we haven't gained many followers yet. I am going to reach out to creators to see if I can republish their work. I haven't revamped the website yet because I am living in a foggy haze and cannot think for the life of me. I feel really bad for putting myself and possibly my group behind.</p>
                    <p>Sammy showed me this really cool platform accessible through ChatGPT to help me create reels. After playing around with it, I realized that it wasn't as seamless as it seemed and that it would cost a lot of money to get it to do what I wanted it to do. I told this to Charlie and Sammy, and Charlie suggested I start taking other creator's content, so I've drafted a couple messages and will hopefully have some "original" content (not AI but not my own) by the end of this week. I will of course be crediting their work to avoid lawsuits.</p>
                    <p>I got the flu! I didn't even know I had been exposed because I have been spending all my time at home because it's cold. I learned that getting sick like this could really put me behind so I need to start planning ahead more for unforeseen circumstances. I also thought that the ChatGPT video creation would be a seamless solution, but that was not the case either.</p>

                    <h3>Week 6</h3>
                    <p>I said my goal was to work on the website. I left this intentionally vague because I didn't know realistically how much I could get done. My end goal is to have a polished website that looks professional and not a website that looks like it was done by someone who took an HTML class once and ran with it. I have since enrolled in an online course so I can get the website looking as cool as possible. I have also been making sure it is optimized for mobile devices, but this is taking a bit of time. I have also been brainstorming ideas for what I want the final website to look like.</p>
                    <p>I talked to Charlie and told him that there were some tabs on the original website that we still haven't conquered, and we have agreed that I will do a different type of formatting, so it's all mostly on one page with skip navigation. He and I also agreed that I should work on optimizing for mobile users, which I hadn't really thought about.</p>
                    <p>I don't have the flu. I have some sort of long lasting mystery virus that feels like a relapse of the bronchitis I had over winter break. It has all the symptoms of the flu, but I tested negative for everything including covid. I have had a really rough week that has thrown me for a giant loop and it is making it really hard to stay on task, especially when I'm sick. I have had a lot of unexpected things happen, such as a friend's cancer diagnosis and the loss of another close friend. It feels as though every semester I've had, something big always happens and I'm slowly learning the lesson of how to get less swayed by it. I used to shut down and fail the semester but now I am managing to only be slightly late sometimes but still managing to get the work done. I am learning to persevere, even when it gets hard. I also learned that people have expectations and if you don't meet them, you will end up disappointing people and getting bad grades, but that has also been a lesson I've been learning. It's hard to communicate when all you want to do is shut down and cry but I'm barely functioning right now as it is. It's hard right now but I know I will get through it. Charlie told me to go for a walk. I did and it made me feel a bit better.</p>

                    <h3>Week 7</h3>
                    <p>The website has been successfully optimized for mobile devices, but I have realized that my website capabilities are not as good as I'd like them to be.</p>
                    <p>We only have one product, which in my opinion changes the layout of the website completely. I have to quickly pivot the entire layout of the website. I also successfully optimized the website for mobile but Charlie pointed out that the navigation bar was missing on some pages so I'll have to work on that. We also discussed getting rid of the navigation bar altogether and put it all on one page. I think I may do two pages, so people can get background information about us and our project. I'll figure it out.</p>

                    <h3>Week 8</h3>
                    <p>I registered for an online HTML class to maximize the potential for the website. My goal for this week includes speed running through it. I have decided on the layout of the website, but I need help executing it. I want to do it manually and not end up using a website builder like Wix.</p>
                    <p>List of Materials I need to complete the website:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Headshots</li>
                        <li>Link from website to onshape</li>
                        <li>Front facing renders of each design</li>
                        <li>Show a photo or two of the finished product</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I sped through the course, but it didn't have what I needed so while I gained new skills, they are not the ones that can help with this. I have navigated through the tabs I need on the webpage, and now all I need to do is implement it!.</p>
                    <p>I asked a bunch of my peers what they thought of the website and how many tabs I should have. I got some pretty solid responses and have decided to continue doing multiple pages instead of consolidating it.</p>
                    <p>Mei Mei is dying again. Maybe. This was expected but also unexpected. She has stopped eating. So have I. The course I paid good money for turned out to be not exactly what I was looking for, but I am determined to make this work. Fridays are for going out. Not this time. It is time for a major worksprint. I honestly am kind of disappointed by the courses ATLAS offers, as I was hoping there would be more than two HTML/Javascript classes, but so it goes. I should've taken it last semester and am having regrets. I admit that I have fallen a bit behind. When it rains, it pours, and I think there's a flood. I am learning that I get stressed when I let people down.</p>

                    <h3>Week 9</h3>
                    <p>My goal for this week was to completely finish the website. I did it. Although it could definitely be polished, all the content is there and it has CSS styling and I think it looks pretty good. I pulled three all nighters because I work best in work sprints and it's hard to stop when I'm in the middle of one. The work sprints were 12+ hours each. I cancelled all my plans and barely left my room, but I got it done.</p>
                    <p>Charlie ended up getting COVID so I had to learn his part in a day, while also completing the website. We went through the slides together a bunch of times and I took notes on every little thing he said I forgot and managed to include a good 95% of it when it was time to actually present.</p>
                    <p>Charlie getting COVID was a bit unexpected, but I realized this week that I believed in myself more than I should have. I thought creating a website would be easy and fun but it turns out there's all of this fancy technology that I never really learned how to use, such as Bootstrap or JavaScript. I do know a little Javascript, but it's not enough. There is so much in the world of web development that I have yet to learn and I'm a senior. I felt really useless at times for overestimating my ability. I spent more money on more classes and did online lessons so hopefully I'll be able to utilize the Javascript and Bootstrap by the time the project is complete, but at least the website is useable and finished, although there is always room for improvement.</p>

                    <h3>Week 10</h3>
                    <p>I finally figured out how to secure the website, thanks to the help of the internet. It took a lot of hours, but nothing too heinous. I also fixed typos and alignment and such, although I couldn't quite figure out how to adjust the margins of the contact box.</p>
                    <p>I met with Charlie who wants me to completely revamp the website to align with a slightly different vision. This was after I met my goals for the week, so I will be implementing all of his feedback soon. We also got feedback that we should not make our product free, so instead of an adaptable CAD file, the user must submit a contact form to purchase the product.</p>
                    <p>I learned that there is always room for improvement, even if you think you're done. I am trying my hardest to feel good enough. Realizing that I need to redo the website is really stressful to me, especially because my birthday is this weekend and my best friend who I haven't seen in years is flying out, but I don't know if I'll have time to enjoy it because my only free time is really on the weekend. I am really stressed. I also learned how to secure a website. It was unexpected when I realized it was much harder than I thought it would be to edit the margins for the contact form.</p>

                    <h3>Week 11</h3>
                    <p>With the help of Sammy, the website has now been completely redesigned to reflect a more intentional and professional structure. We've moved from a multi-tab layout to a consolidated, streamlined experience that is easier for users to navigate. Instead of offering free downloadable files, we now require visitors to fill out a contact form to request a purchase. This change helps us protect our intellectual property and aligns better with our long-term business model. I spent the week implementing this new layout, troubleshooting navigation inconsistencies, and testing the mobile view on various devices. I also began drafting updated website copy with a more cohesive tone. It's starting to feel like a real business now, not just a class project. I'm finally finding some satisfaction in how everything is coming together, even though it's been a long road.</p>

                    <h3>Week 12</h3>
                    <p>This week was about polishing and preparing. I fine-tuned the margins and spacing across the site and made sure all links are functional and redirect correctly. I coordinated with Charlie and Sammy to gather the latest renders and updated product images for the site. We also added a testimonial section and began preparing the site for public launch. It's surreal to see how far we've come. What started as a rough HTML skeleton is now a fully functioning, mobile-optimized, visually cohesive site that represents our capstone project. I've grown a lot, not just technically, but also in how I handle unexpected setbacks and feedback. There's still more to do, but the foundation is finally solid. I feel proud of what I've built.</p>
